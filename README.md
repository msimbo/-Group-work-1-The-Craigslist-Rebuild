# Craigslist Rebuild
Using Alpine.js, we were able to create a highly interactive and dynamic user interface that allows users to easily search and browse for items. The filtering and sorting features you added using Alpine.js make it easy for users to find exactly what they're looking for, and the pop-up modals you integrated allow for a smooth and seamless user experience.
Meanwhile, the styling of your Craigslist rebuild project using Tailwind CSS is both beautiful and functional.
